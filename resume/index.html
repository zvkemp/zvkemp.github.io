<h4>2010 &ndash; present: WolfBrown</h4>

<h3>Manager of Digital Assets &amp; Lead Developer</h3>

<p>WolfBrown is a multidisciplinary research and consulting firm that mainly serves the non-profit arts sector.
I joined the San Francisco office in 2010, and have since transitioned into near full-time software development. I am the sole developer, designer, and server administrator for two major projects, as well as numerous smaller internal tools and websites.</p>

<h5><a href="https://culturelab.net">CULTURELAB</a></h5>

<p>An online social hub and repository of consulting materials and publications related to the arts sector
(currently in private beta).
The CultureLab website is currently in active use by a small number of arts consultants, practitioners, and students, and is currently undergoing a planning phase to begin a broader public roll-out.</p>

<p>In addition to the repository&rsquo;s main function as a social publishing and information-sharing platform, it also functions as WolfBrown&rsquo;s private archive of several decades of intellectual property and client work.</p>

<h5><a href="http://intrinsicimpact.org">INTRINSICIMPACT.ORG</a></h5>

<p>Dashboards for arts organizations.
I created the IntrinsicImpact.org dashboard to replace a cumbersome and inflexible site built on Microsoft&rsquo;s SSRS.
The Dashboard uses a combination of MySQL and MongoDB to offer flexible, intuitive queries and data transformations of audience feedback data.
The data is visualized using a custom Ruby SVG generator (which I am currently re-implementing on top of d3.js).
Due to the flexibility and ease of reporting, IntrinsicImpact.org has allowed WolfBrown to offer low-cost consulting services as a subscription service.</p>

<p>In addition to my work as a developer, I am responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design and typesetting of several major publications</li>
<li>Creation of infographics to supplement major research publications</li>
<li>Facilitating surveying and data reporting (through IntrinsicImpact.org) for an ongoing project to evaluate new classical music concert formats with the New World Symphony and several partner orchestras</li>
<li>GIS Mapping and analysis</li>
<li>Analysis and transformation of a wide variety of datasets, including primary research data and external sources (e.g., US Census Data)</li>
</ul>
